              If Cake Mortgage chooses not to match the competing lender’s
              offer, you will need to provide Cake Mortgage with certain
              Required Documentation, which is described below. You must also
              close your mortgage with that lender and submit the Required
              Documentation showing you received a better rate along with an
              application for the Cake Mortgage Best Rate Program Guarantee
              within 30-days of closing that loan. After a full review of the
              application and the Required Documentation has been completed and
              it is determined that you qualify, your Piece of Cake Price Reward
              check for $1,000 will be sent approximately 6-8 weeks after
              submission of the Required Documentation.{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
              The documentation you must provide to us before being sent your
              Piece of Cake Price Reward check for $1,000 is your lender’s final
              closing disclosure and loan estimate (“Final Competing
              Disclosure”) that shows that the Interest Rate and Total
              Origination Charges (Page 2. Loan Cost, A. Origination Charges)
              were equal to or lower than those disclosed in your Cake Mortgage
              disclosure (“Cake Mortgage Disclosure”). In addition, your closed
              loan must have the same terms (property, property value, loan
              term, purpose, product, and loan type) as those shown in the Cake
              Mortgage Disclosure (and these along with your W-9, Promissory
              Note, and the Final Competing Disclosure and Cake Mortgage
              Disclosure referenced above are defined as the “Required
              Documentation”). Below are detailed requirements that must be met
              for you to be eligible to receive the Piece of Cake Price Reward.{' '}

              <li>
                You must provide the loan estimate from your lender within 24
                hours of speaking with Cake Mortgage, Loan Estimate must be
                locked and dated within 24 hours of contact with a licensed loan
                officer at Cake Mortgage and the final Competing Closing
                Disclosure must be for the same property, property value, loan
                term, purpose, product, and loan type as the Cake Mortgage
                program.
              </li>
              <li>
                Receiving the Piece of Cake Price Reward is contingent on you
                providing the information necessary for Cake Mortgage to make a
                credit underwriting decision and provide you with a customized
                interest rate quote and approval. Once approved, you are
                required to register your loan with Cake Mortgage for
                consideration of this offer. This registration requires an
                application fee deposit. If you provide a competing lender's
                offer along with the Required Documentation and we cannot match
                the offer, you will be refunded your application fee deposit.
                The Required Documentation you provide must show that the
                interest rate and total origination charges were equal to or
                lower than those disclosed in your Cake Mortgage Disclosure.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the loan product is an adjustable rate product, the initial
                rate, rate index, time of rate adjustment and rate cap must also
                be the same as for the product you are requesting from Cake
                Mortgage. The interest rates being compared must be for the same
                lock in term and must be within the range of interest rates that
                we are quoting on our website.
              </li>
              <li>
                We reserve the right to verify that the competing lender's
                interest rate and points/fees quote is bona fide.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cake Mortgage may, in its sole discretion, accept loan estimate
                proxies (e.g., rate sheets from other lenders) provided the rate
                and terms from the competitive lender are not contingent on any
                other transaction or relationship. In addition, the loan
                estimate proxy must contain information sufficient to
                demonstrate that the offer is intended for the borrower who is
                applying for a loan with Cake Mortgage and contain proof that
                the borrower's credit score was verified.

                The Final Competing Disclosure may not be from a broker or
                lender who Cake Mortgage provides loan originating and/or
                brokerage services. If you shop a competing lender first, you
                are required to provide Cake Mortgage with the Final Competing
                Disclosure. The document from the competing lender must be dated
                the same day as the request to Cake Mortgage to match the other
                lender's offer and must be submitted to Cake Mortgage within 24
                hours of registration
