            <h4>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?</h4>
            <p>
              We take the security of the information we collect and maintain
              very seriously. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosures, we
              utilize physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect
              all the information we collect and maintain, including any
              personal information you voluntarily provide.{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
              We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety
              of your personal information and to reduce the risk of accidental
              destruction, loss, unauthorized disclosures, alteration, or
              access, including:{' '}
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Password protection, encryption, and use of secure communication
                transmission software (known as “secure socket layering” or
                “SSL”) to protect our Site and Services;
              </li>
              <li>Using 128-bit encryption for all online access;</li>
              <li>
                Utilizing a firewall to block unauthorized entry into our Site;
              </li>
              <li>
                Placing confidentiality requirements on our employees and
                service providers;
              </li>
              <li>
                Destroying or permanently anonymizing personal information if it
                is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected;
              </li>
              <li>
                Following strict security procedures in the storage and
                disclosure of your personal information to prevent unauthorized
                access to it; and
              </li>
              <li>Physical access controls to our data centers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide appropriate
              security for the information we collect and maintain, no security
              system can prevent all potential security breaches. While we take
              technical and organizational measures to safeguard your personal
              information, no transmission over the internet can ever be
              guaranteed to be secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the
              security of any personal information that you transfer over the
              internet to use and any such transmission is at your own risk.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the security of personal information depends in part on the
              security of the computer or device you use to communicate with use
              and the security you use to protect usernames and passwords, you
              should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your
              password, computer, and web-enabled devices by signing off after
              using a shared computer, inserting a password on your web-enabled
              device, choosing a password that nobody else knows or can easily
              guess, keeping your password private, and periodically changing
              your password. You should never share your log in information with
              others. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or
              compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via
              unauthorized password activity.
            </p>

            <p>
              As an additional security measure, the Site will automatically log
              you off after a period of inactivity. This reduces the risk of
              others accessing your information from your unattended computer.
            </p>
            <h4>HOW LONG DO WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h4>
            <p>
              We will store your personal information for as long as is
              reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected.
              Where your information is no longer needed, we will ensure that it
              is disposed of in a secure manner. In some circumstances we may
              store your personal information for longer periods of time, for
              instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal,
              regulatory, tax, or accounting requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              In certain circumstances, we may store your personal information
              for longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of
              your dealings with us in the events of any complaints or
              challenges, or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of
              litigation relating to your personal information or dealings.
            </p>

              however, they may be circumstances where we are required to share
              information. For example, we share your personal information with

              such as IT service providers. These third parties have agreed to
              confidentiality restrictions and have agreed to use any personal
              information we share with them, or which they collect on our
              behalf, solely for the purpose of providing the contracted service
              to us.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may share your personal information with government
              organizations, law enforcement, and regulators, to comply with all

              regulatory, and other governmental agencies in response to legal
              process.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may share your personal information with banks and payment
              providers to authorize and complete credit card payments.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
              If, in the future, we are acquired by or merged with another
              company, if substantially all our assets are transferred to
              another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceedings, we may
              disclose or transfer the information we have collected from you to
              the acquiring company.
            </p>
            <h4>DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?</h4>
            <p>
              We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise transfer your personally
              identifiable information to third parties.
