              Cookies and these other technologies can help us automatically

              in a particular subject area.

              When you use the Services, the information that we may collect by

            <h4>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?</h4>
            <p>
              We take the security of the information we collect and maintain
              very seriously. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosures, we
              utilize physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect
              all the information we collect and maintain, including any
              personal information you voluntarily provide.
            </p>
            <p>
              We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety
              of your personal information and to reduce the risk of accidental
              destruction, loss, unauthorized disclosures, alteration, or
              access, including:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Password protection, encryption, and use of secure
                  communication transmission software (known as “secure socket
                  layering” or “SSL”) to protect our Site and Services;
                </li>
                <li>Using 128-bit encryption for all online access;</li>
                <li>
                  Utilizing a firewall to block unauthorized entry into our
                  Site;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Placing confidentiality requirements on our employees and
                  service providers;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Destroying or permanently anonymizing personal information if
                  it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was
                  collected;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Following strict security procedures in the storage and
                  disclosure of your personal information to prevent
                  unauthorized access to it; and
                </li>
                <li>Physical access controls to our data centers.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide appropriate
              security for the information we collect and maintain, no security
              system can prevent all potential security breaches. Therefore, we
              cannot guarantee the security of any personal information that you
              transfer over the internet to use and any such transmission is at
              your own risk.
            </p>

            <p>
              As the security of personal information depends in part on the
              security of the computer or device you use to communicate with use
              and the security you use to protect usernames and passwords, you
              should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your
              password, computer, and webenabled devices by signing off after
              using a shared computer, inserting a password on your webenabled
              device, choosing a password that nobody else knows or can easily
              guess, keeping your password private, and periodically changing
              your password. You should never share your log in information with
              others. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or
              compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via
              unauthorized password activity.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an additional security measure, the Site will automatically log
              you off after a period of inactivity. This reduces the risk of
              others accessing your information from your unattended computer.
            </p>

            <h4>HOW LONG DO WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h4>
            <p>
              We will store your personal information for as long as is
              reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected.
              Where your information is no longer needed, we will ensure that it
              is disposed of in a secure manner. In some circumstances we may
              store your personal information for longer periods of time, for
              instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal,
              regulatory, tax, or accounting requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              In certain circumstances, we may store your personal information
