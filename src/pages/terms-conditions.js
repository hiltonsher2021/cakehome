            <p>
              THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL GOVERN THESE TERMS AND
              ANY DISPUTE RELATING TO THE SERVICES, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY
              PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS. EXCLUDING DISPUTES ADDRESSED
              THROUGH ARBITRATION AS PROVIDED BELOW, YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE
              EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COMPETENT STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS
              LOCATED IN CHATSWORTH, CALIFORNIA IN RELATION TO ANY CLAIM,
              DISPUTE OR DIFFERENCE ARISING FROM THESE TERMS, AND YOU AGREE TO
              WAIVE ANY RIGHT OF REMOVAL OR TRANSFER WHETHER DUE TO FORUM NON
              CONVENIENS OR OTHER REASON. The United Nations Convention on
              Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform

              excluded from these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief, any
              dispute or controversy arising out of or relating to the Services
              or these Terms, including without limitation, any and all
              disputes, claims (whether in tort, contract, statutory or
              otherwise) or disagreements concerning the existence, breach,
              interpretation, application or termination of the Terms, shall be
              resolved by final and binding arbitration in accordance with the
              JAMS Inc. Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures then in
              effect. There shall be no right or authority for any claims to be
              arbitrated on a class action basis. The arbitration shall be
              administered by JAMS and take place in the state of California or
              at the option of the party seeking relief, online, by telephone,
              online, in your state of residence or via written submissions
              alone. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on
              the parties. Judgment on any award(s) rendered by the arbitrator
              may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Nothing
              in this section shall prevent either party from seeking immediate
              injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, and
              any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with the
              agreement to arbitrate or a waiver of the right to arbitrate. The
              parties undertake to keep confidential all awards in their
              arbitration, together with all confidential information, all
              materials in the proceedings created for the purpose of the
              arbitration and all other documents produced by the other party in
              the proceedings and not otherwise in the public domain, save and
              to the extent that disclosure may be required of a party by legal
              duty, to protect or pursue a legal right or to enforce or
              challenge an award in legal proceedings before a court or other
              judicial authority.
            </p>
            <p>
              TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE
              THAT EACH PARTY TO A DISPUTE HEREUNDER MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST

              PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
              ACTION. Unless both you and we agree, no arbitrator or judge may
              consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside
              over any form of a representative or class proceeding
            </p>

              Terms by reference, constitute the complete and exclusive
              statement of the agreement between you and Cake Mortgage, and
              supersedes all other proposals or prior agreements oral or
              written, and any other communications relating to the subject
              matter of these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is found
              unenforceable, it shall not affect the validity of the remainder
              of these Terms, which shall remain valid and enforceable according
              to its terms, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be
              deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most
              closely matches the intent of the original provision and the
              remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect. You agree
              that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency
              relationship exists between you and Cake Mortgage as a result of
              these Terms or your use of the Services.
